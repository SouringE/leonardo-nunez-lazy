The article is facinating in the sense that the author really pushes
for this hacking is painting metaphor. Being an opinion statement, the article lacks
evidence for most fo these opinions (see their claim that computer science is a poor description). His claim, is 
in a "real" science, you aren't supposed to be the one creating the thing you study. 
Hackers, however, build the objects of their study.

Furthermore, he claims He asserts that computer scientists suffer from "math envy," 
over-complicating papers with formulas just to look like "real" scientists, which he 
views as a waste of a hacker’s time.

However, one point I really value is the emphasis on "empathy". I agree that seeing the product
throguh the users eyes (whether is front-end or back-end programming) is a critical advantage
that also conveniently makes programming on a project easier to return to.
